# Release QA checklist

Run this whole checklist on **both** OS images before tagging a release. Ideally use clean VMs (Hyper-V or VirtualBox) so leftover state from previous runs does not mask install bugs.

## Before you test (repo & build)

- [ ] **Hermes submodule** is present and at the commit expected for this build. After clone, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Release notes and `CHANGES_*.md` may call out a specific **hermes** revision; a mismatch can break the Python bundle or the embedded web UI.
- [ ] If you build from source, use the same **tag or branch** the release is cut from, not a random main checkout.
- [ ] **Windows Defender / real-time scan** can hold file locks during bundling or first run (symptoms: `os error 32`, failed copy, or `python.exe` / build scripts failing to overwrite files). For **local dev** or **repeated bundle builds**, add exclusions for the repo path and, if needed, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesDesk` and your `python\dist` build output—then retry from a clean tree if a run was interrupted mid-write.

## Target images

| Image                    | Why                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Windows 10 22H2 x64      | Lowest supported. Has WebView2 evergreen.  |
| Windows 11 23H2 x64      | Default for new PCs.                       |
| Windows 10 LTSC 2021     | (Optional) Stripped image; catches missing OS bits. |

## What you are testing (current product)

- **Shell (Tauri + `web/`)**: Splash, onboarding, Settings, system tray, locale toggle. The shell does **not** auto-open the Hermes web app on every return visit—you choose when to open it.
- **Embedded Hermes web** (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`): Dashboard-style UI (status, config, sessions, etc.) served by the bundled Hermes Python stack. It is **not** a full standalone “chat app” in one screen; **桌面试聊** and deeper in-shell chat are **roadmap**, not a missing entry.
- **Language**: When you open the dashboard from the shell, the app passes `hermesdesk_lang=zh|en` so the Hermes web first paint can match the shell language.

## A. Install

- [ ] Download `.msi` from GitHub Releases over a normal browser
- [ ] SmartScreen status:
  - [ ] OV-only build: shows "More info" -> publisher = HermesDesk
  - [ ] After warm-up: no warning at all
- [ ] Double-click the `.msi`
  - [ ] No UAC prompt (per-user install)
  - [ ] Finishes within 60s on a clean SSD
  - [ ] Start Menu has "HermesDesk"
  - [ ] No desktop shortcut unless we ship one (we don't, by design)
- [ ] Disk usage at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesDesk` is between 80 and 200 MB

## B. First launch (cold)

- [ ] App opens within a few seconds (Splash visible)
- [ ] If no API key yet: routes to **onboarding** (no Hermes web yet)
- [ ] If a key already exists: Splash shows **returning** copy and a primary button to **open the Hermes dashboard** in the same window (does **not** auto-navigate by itself)
- [ ] No console window flashes or stays open
- [ ] Tray icon appears
- [ ] `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesDesk\logs\hermesdesk.log` exists and contains a line like `python ready on port` with a port number (Hermes is up)

## C. Onboarding wizard (zero-jargon happy path)

- [ ] Welcome screen wording reads naturally to a non-tech tester
- [ ] "Pick a brain" - tap "Free starter" -> "Get your access pass"
- [ ] "Open OpenRouter in browser" - opens default browser, **not** in-app
- [ ] Paste a known-good key, hit "Save and continue":
  - [ ] Validation succeeds within a few seconds
  - [ ] No plaintext key in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesDesk\settings.json`
  - [ ] `cmdkey /list:HermesDesk*` lists the credential
- [ ] Pick a vibe -> **Done** page renders
- [ ] "Open workspace folder" opens `Documents\HermesWork` in Explorer
- [ ] The Done primary CTA invokes **open dashboard** (navigates the main webview to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` with optional `hermesdesk_lang=...`), not a separate "chat-only" shell screen

## D. Hermes web (embedded dashboard) sanity

- [ ] After opening from Splash or Done, the main window shows the **Hermes** web UI (not a blank page). If you see "not ready", wait a few seconds and use **open dashboard** again.
- [ ] **Smoke**: From the Hermes UI, run a minimal interaction your build supports (e.g. status page loads, or a short model-backed request if **桌面试聊** is enabled in that build). Expectations depend on the Hermes revision bundled for the release.
- [ ] (When applicable) Drop a `.txt` file into the workspace folder and confirm Hermes/your test flow can see workspace-scoped tools—aligned with that release’s Hermes capabilities.
- [ ] (When applicable) Ask for an action that should be **jailed** to the workspace; out-of-workspace paths should be denied with a clear error.

## E. Safety / Power user

- [ ] In Settings, attempt to enable Power user - confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Enable, then ask the agent to run `dir`:
  - [ ] Native Windows dialog appears with the command and CWD
  - [ ] "Deny" leaves the workspace untouched
  - [ ] "Allow this once" runs it; output reaches the chat or tool surface your build uses
  - [ ] Re-asking later still re-prompts (no implicit "always allow")
- [ ] Disable Power user, restart - Power-user-only tools no longer appear in the agent's tool list

## F. Persistence + restart

- [ ] Quit via tray "Quit" - no orphan `python.exe` in Task Manager
- [ ] Reopen - skips onboarding; Splash **returning** page appears (user taps **open dashboard** to load Hermes again)
- [ ] Reboot the VM, open the app - same behavior, key still works

## G. Network allowlist

- [ ] In Power-user mode, ask the agent to fetch `https://example.com` - blocked with a clear error message
- [ ] Settings -> add `example.com` to extra hosts -> retry - succeeds

## H. Updates

- [ ] Install v0.1.0
- [ ] Publish v0.1.1 release with bumped version
- [ ] Tray menu -> "Check for updates" finds it
- [ ] Click update -> download progress visible
- [ ] After restart, Settings shows v0.1.1
- [ ] Workspace folder + saved key carried forward

## I. Uninstall

- [ ] Settings -> Apps -> HermesDesk -> Uninstall
- [ ] No UAC prompt
- [ ] Removes `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesDesk\` (or leaves only the workspace folder under `Documents\` - confirm we never delete user docs)
- [ ] Tray icon disappears
- [ ] Credential Manager entry is removed (or, if not, `Sign out` did it before uninstall and we documented the split)

## J. Crash recovery

- [ ] Kill `python.exe` from Task Manager - Tauri shows a recovery path within a few seconds (e.g. helper restart prompt), consistent with current implementation
- [ ] Confirm recovery restores normal operation after accepting the prompt

## K. Accessibility smoke

- [ ] Tab order through onboarding is sensible
- [ ] Screen reader (NVDA) reads each step's heading and primary action
- [ ] System "high contrast" theme does not break the wizard
