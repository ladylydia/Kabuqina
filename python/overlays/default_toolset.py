"""Seed Hermes' tool config to the HermesDesk keep-list.

# DEPRECATED: tool_policy.remove_when=Phase4
# Target replacement: ``python/src/tool_policy.py``

Hermes selects the active toolsets by reading
``~/.hermes/config.yaml`` (under HERMES_HOME) at the
``platform_toolsets["cli"]`` key. The CLI's `hermes tools` configurator
maintains it interactively. There is no programmatic "default" function
to monkey-patch; the source of truth is the file.

For HermesDesk we *write* a deterministic config on first launch (and on
every launch when the Power-user toggle changes), so the user never has
to use `hermes tools` from a terminal they don't have.

Beyond the desktop (``cli``) key, this overlay **locks every gateway platform
key** (``telegram``, ``weixin``, ``discord``, etc.) to the non-power-user
keep-list.  Gateway bots never receive expanded tools regardless of the
power-user toggle.  See ``ToolPolicy.gateway_keep_list()``.

The toolset-resolution logic is delegated to
``python/src/tool_policy.py`` (Phase 3D).  This overlay only
writes the config file.
