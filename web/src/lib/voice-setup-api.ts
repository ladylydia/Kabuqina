 * pairs to ``hermes-home/.env`` (which also refreshes ``os.environ`` so the
 * running Python process picks up the new key without a restart).
 *
 * - ``provider = null`` leaves the existing setting untouched (used when the
 *   user picks "skip" or hasn't selected anything).
 * - Empty values in ``env`` are dropped on the Python side so blanks never
 *   overwrite a previously-saved key. Keys outside an internal allow-list
 *   are silently dropped.
